# Hello-World-as-one
the beginning of geek'ish.
This is a trial and error in the attemt to learn one day to code some cool stuff.
havent coded anything yet but in the beginning of commodora 64 when loading a game and "press play on tape" (not really coding).
know how to recall the CMD.
know how to find a Dir.
know how to change dir.
have attempted to run the ouboruswallet, failed.
need to learn a programming language.
bought NodeJS lifetime access..
Failed to start the NodeJS master class.
need to learn JavaScript first.
started an idea with a friend.
idea is to learn blockchain.
now considering what language, either solidity or python.
the feeling about the "becomming geek'ish" state of mind is so huge and hard to grasp.
what to do?.
where to begin?.
suggestions are welcomed warmheartedly!!!!!!.
OooMmm
